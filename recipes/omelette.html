    <h1>Omelette Recipe</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A well-made omelet is the icing on the cake for breakfast.
        Although the ingredients may vary, if you have 3 or 4 eggs to prepare a fluffy <strong>omelet recipe</strong>, that's it!
        Of course, you can make a plain omelet with 1 or 2 eggs, if you wish, by reducing the amount of butter and olive oil.
        The <em>well-beaten eggs</em> are placed in the pan and cooked in a short time. It should be neither watery nor too solid.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the omelet, put 4 eggs in a deep mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>Combine half a teaspoon of salt and pepper. Beat well with a whisk from bottom to top until air bubbles form.</li>
        <li>Heat your pan and heat 1 tablespoon each of butter and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Then pour the egg mixture into the pan. Reduce the heat of your stove and cook until the bottom part is browned.</li>
        <li>When the bottom part of the omelet is browned and the top part is slightly watery, tilt your pan first and fold the omelet in half.</li>
        <li>Cook for another 1-2 minutes and remove from the stove.</li>
        <li>Serve the omelet with breakfast items before it cools down. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
